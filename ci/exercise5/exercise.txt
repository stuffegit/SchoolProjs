Using TDD and googletest develop and test a greeting function according to the following requirements.
    The function prototype shall be: std::string greet(const std::string &name);
        [X]The function shall handle nulls.
            [x]If name is an empty string, then the method shall return the string "Hello, my friend."
        [x]The function shall interpolate the name in a simple greeting. For example:
            [x]If name is "Bob", the method shall return a string "Hello, Bob.".
        [x]The function shall handle shouting. If name is all uppercase, then it should shout back to the 
                user. For examples:
            [x]If name is "JERRY", the method shall return the string "HELLO JERRY!"
        [x]The function shall handle two names. If name is a string of two names, then both names should 
                be printed. For examples:
                [x]If name is "Jill, Jane", the method shall return the string "Hello, Jill and Jane."
                [x]If name is "BOB, JANE", the method shall return the string "HELLO BOB AND JANE!"
        [x]The function shall handle an arbitrary number of names.  If name represents more than two names,
        separate them with commas and close with an Oxford comma and "and". For examples:
            [x]If name is "Amy, Brian, Charlotte", the method shall return the string "Hello, Amy, Brian, 
                and Charlotte."
            [x]If name is "BRIAN, BOB, JANE", the method shall return the string "HELLO BRIAN, BOB, AND JANE!"
        [ ]The function shall allow mixing of normal and shouted names by separating the response into two 
        greetings. For examples:
            [ ]If name is "Amy, BRIAN, Charlotte", the method shall return the string "Hello, Amy and Charlotte.
                AND HELLO BRIAN!"
            [ ]If name is "Amy, BRIAN, Charlotte, BOB, Jill, JANE", the method shall return the string 
                "Hello, Amy, Charlotte, and Jill. AND HELLO BRIAN, BOB, AND JANE!"
        [ ]To build and run the test, use a cmake file.
