I'm not sure if I did what You wanted in this assignment. 
I understand the nature of CRC from the links provided in the assignment info but I might have misunderstood the requirements.
It's very possible that I failed this one, however I will link it along to show I attempted it.

You can compile it normally with gcc, no extra flags are needed however I added ./build.sh and ./run.sh on linux/WSL if You prefer.


Extras:
- fgets adding the newline had me scratching my head for a bit
- i was wondering how to simulate actual crc transmission and hopefully the line:60 logic makes sense
- calculate_crc(); was very confusing, bitwise logic might be really off but I tried
- verify_crc(); is super lazy, i'm not sure how to do this in another way. Initially I tried to reverse-CRC but it had me stumped
