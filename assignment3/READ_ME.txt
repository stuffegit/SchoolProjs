I hope I did this in the way you wanted to. 
Almost all of it was things that we have used before. 
I used a lot of pointers to try and show I understand it and am comfortable using it for its intended purpose.

You can compile it normally with gcc, no extra flags are needed however I added ./build.sh and ./run.sh on linux/WSL if You prefer.

Extra: 
- I wasn't sure how much commenting you wanted so I might have gone a bit overboard, in the places I didn't put comments I tried to make it readable and verbose.
