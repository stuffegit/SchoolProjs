Make an uncopyable, but movable template queue class using a linked
list to provide the following functions:

A function to enqueue a data element to a queue.
A function to dequeue a data element from a queue.
A function to get the number of data elements stored in a queue.
A function to clear a queue.

Use exception handling when you allocate memory dynamically.
Test the class using assertions and ensure that all the allocated
memory blocks are released and the class is movable.
