Implement and test an uncopyable, but movable template
stack class using an array whose size is specified during
creation(size shall be greater than three)
The class shall provide the following function:

A function to get size of a stack.
A function to push a data element to a stack.
A function to get number of the data elements stored in a stack.
A function to pop an element from a stack.
A function to clear a stack

Use exception handling, test the class using assertions,
ensure that the dynamic memory is managed properly and
the class is movable.
