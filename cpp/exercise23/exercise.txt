A square is a shape which has a length(four equal sides).

Every shape has a name and an area. 
Every point has x and y on the 2d cartesian coordinate system.

Make a Shape class and a Point class.

Make a Circle class based on Shape.
  The class shall have a function to get area of a circle.

  It shall be possible to check if two circles 
  are equal or not by overloading the == operator.

Make a Square class based on Shape. 
The class shall have a function to get area of a square.

Make a function to print area of any shape.
